# KCTErrorExtractor
Extracts error types from the Karslruhe Childrens' Texts corpus

*annotated_document.py* reads documents in the format of the KCT corpus () or the H1/H2 corpus () and retrieves information on different error types from it. You may output the target hypothesis and the original writing as two sperate plain text files and additionally extract statistics on different error types saved in a separate csv.

See *main_extract_h1_or_h2.py* and *main_extract_kct.py* for use examples.
